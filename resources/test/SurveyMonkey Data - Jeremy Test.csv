I had to take it upon myself to look for resources to help with the college process. Applying to medical school is a whole different situation. While I do have resources at my college, I feel like it's more comforting to be able to meet with someone individually. At Hunter, a majority of the STEM majors are actively pursuing medical school. So there's only so much our pre-health advisors can do for us. It's just better to have an individualized experience because they're able to address your personal issues over general issues of the student body. Everyone's path to medical school is different. Being able to hear someone's story will help me pinpoint where to start. Also having someone's feedback on what you were already doing (summer research, clinical research) is helpful.","I guess it's the aspect of being able to speak with someone who was once in your position. While you may not have experienced similar hardships or be under the same circumstances, what we have in common is the pursuit of medical school during our undergraduate years. Just being able to hear how someone got to where they are is helpful because you get a sense of what to look out for and reflect about yourself and how you're going about it. You're no longer dealing with the process alone because someone will be there to give you guidance.","Well I'll list a few. On the last week of lent, my mom makes this traditional, Ecuadorian soup called Fanesca. How I used to describe it as a kid is ""fish soup"". The type of music that we dance to at parties can be described as a range of merengue, cumbia and traditional Ecuadorian music. I was exposed to Ecuadorian culture the most when I visited my family there. I was exposed to their traditional dishes (guinea pig) as well the dances they perform in celebration of a saint.","Before you sit down at a family gathering, you must greet everyone. Do not leave without saying goodbye to everyone, especially your elders. For celebrations, while there is a set time, it is expected that a majority of those invited arrive around 1-2 hours later. It takes a while for the party to begin. My family isn't too strict with regards to formal and informal language as long as we are respectful.

For certain holidays we have various traditions. For example, for our day of the dead, we make a drink called ""Colada Morada"" and bread called ""Guaguas de Pan"". We typically celebrate it at the beginning of November and the drink symbolizes the deceased's blood and bread represent their body to put it in the simplest way. It is a bit similar to a religious viewpoint. It always feels cozy and the process of making it is very long but very rewarding. Our family usually comes together and we are grateful to have each other. I love that food can bring us together and it is also something that everyone enjoys. When I went to Ecuador in past years, I often bonded most with my family through food events and discussions.","Some major things that I have grown up with have typically always been related with manners. My mom would always notice manners in any of friends or partners that I'd introduce and that would be the only lasting impression she would have for the rest of their encounters. Our greetings for example are typically always warm with a kiss on the cheek, hug and the host always attending the guest.

Likewise, the pairing with a minority student who understands the process is a great resource to a prospective medical student like myself. I understand that PrIMES will set me up for success.","With both a curriculum and set benchmarks, the PrIMES program seems to push students towards progress and better preparation for the medical school application and med school in general.

Therefore, I understand that I will be taught skills useful to me as I persure more education.","I am Venezuelan. Venezuela has a plethora of amazing foods including arepas, tequeños, cachapas, and more. Most of the dishes are corn-based and recipes are shared with neighboring countries. Religious holidays are national holidays in Venezuela. The country is mostly Roman Catholic with other Christian denominations following as the second most practiced religion. Each province has their saint or a specific holiday. Venezuelan music and art are highly influenced by Carribean themes. Gaitas Zulianas, a style of music from my province that falls under folk focuses on romantic and political stories. Common instruments are the cuatro, maracas, and tambora.","A big part of Venezuelan culture revolves around family and religion. There, the concept of leaving home at 18 is more strange than staying home throughout college (unlike the US). The family also tends to live relatively close to one another.  The extended family is not a separated from the nuclear family or closer relatives. Close friends are also considered family and even introduced to children as such.  As mentioned previously, religion ties very closely to culture. Children, as well as adults, ask for a blessing from their elders in greetings and goodbyes. Nonetheless, it is customary that you greet/say goodbye to everyone with a bendición. The respect towards elders is also seen in the language as in Spanish, one can use more respectful words or conjugations to denote feelings of respect towards someone. The elderly usually represent wisdom and are very respected. When making big decisions, their opinions are always valued and considered.

While I am still learning more about the origins of my Guyanese background, much of my culture is circumnavigated by Caribbean and Indian traditions (food, lifestyle, religious attire, etc) because my home country (Guyana) is located in South America. I practice the Hindu religion but am open-minded about other faith systems. The Guyanese culture is widely open-minded about different cultural influences and its music like religious Sanskrit (Hindu religious songs), Hindi, and reggae. The food that I eat is  inspired by vegetarian Indian/African/British cuisine and its varieties are endless. Some examples are flatbread (roti), curried vegetables, and lentils. I practice religious Hindu holidays, like Diwali and Navratri, and my family also celebrate Christian holidays, like Christmas. My cultural diversity defines who I am and I take much pride in it. I also love to meet people of different backgrounds to learn more about their cultural influences as well!","In my culture, respect is the most important unspoken rule in everyday social interactions. I was raised to always respect others opinions, beliefs, and theories. Each individual has their own perception of the world and I was expected to respect that concept. The elderly are to be treated with the uttermost respect and compassion because they are believed to be the most wise and knowledgable. I was also raised to form relationships with people who would have a positive impact on me for the sake of my mental wellness. Finally, the concept of time is widely emphasized.

Traditional Nigerian dishes range from spicy to even spicier, and I love it. One of my favorites is suya, which is tiny pieces of beef covered in ""suya spice,"" which has fire in it that comes straight from the sun. When it comes to traditional dress, Nigerians waste no amount of color or style. Even the men dress as fabulously as the women do; they wear something called agbada and a hat while the women wear gele with their traditional dresses. These are usually worn at big events or parties, which can last up to twelve hours (I've been to a party in Nigeria that literally lasted twelve hours). At these parties, the music is playing so loudly that you feel the beat in your chest. Although to make up for it, artists like Davido, Wizkid, and Burna Boy make their music impossible not to dance to.","In Nigerian culture, children are expected to respect their elders and offer to do any housework in their place. For example, it's rude to let an elder or a guest clean up after you.

I really enjoy science and I enjoy helping others, and being a physician means that I would be able to merge these passions. I am interested in being a physician but I am not sure how or where to reach out to for help and information involving the application process and experience of being a medical student and a physician. I believe talking to people who are in a position I want to be in is a great way to learn about the path of becoming a physician, and PrIMES is the perfect way for me to connect with medical students and receive their input about the process of applying to medical school.","I think PrRIMES will help me become more organized as an applicant. Being able to speak to medical students and to be mentored by them is very helpful because they can help me better realize my strengths and weaknesses, and how to use them to improve as an applicant. I can learn about the application process and what’s needed to be a competitive applicant on my own, but to have someone who was in my situation give me advice on how to improve as an applicant is priceless. They can help me improve in areas I may not know how to improve in, or in areas I may not have noticed that needs improvement. I do not have any friends or family who know about applying to medical school, so being able to have a mentor who understands the process is important; they can share information and resources I may not have known about on my own.","My family is from the Dominican Republic, so I eat rice and beans for dinner almost every day (which is a cool and funny experience to think about). My favorite kind of rice and beans is rice with green pigeon peas, which are called gandules. As Dominicans we also enjoy our plátanos (plantains), and in my family we eat them at least once a week (usually a few times a week). My family has a Thanksgiving dinner, even though my mother was not born in America. We celebrate Christmas and it’s my favorite holiday, as well as my mother’s favorite holiday. My mom likes to listen to modern American and Latin music,  but she also loves to listen to her favorite Hispanic songs from the 70’s and 80’s when she was growing up. I sometimes listen to those songs on my own time because they can be very calming and pleasing to the ears. I personally love listening to reggaetón, but I do occasionally listen to bachata.","When someone arrives home, we always greet each other. Whenever someone is leaving the house, we let each other know where we are going. My brothers and I text our mom to let her know where we are. If I am going somewhere, such as school, I text my mom when I am on the train, when I arrive to class, and when I’m on my way home. My mom and I have an unspoken rule that I can’t stay out too late, so if I stay out past 8 or 9 pm, my mother gets really worried (unless I am with her). Whenever my family talks to each other, we make eye contact. My mom has created a safe and fun environment for us where my brothers and I can be friends with our mom, and my mom emphasizes to me that she wants me to regard her as my best friend, which I do.

I can get tips and motivation from these students that'll help me to see that this is the right track for me.","I am African-American and I wouldn't say we have many elements of our culture, at least in my family.

When it comes to elders and older family members, you should always address them formally. Words like tu is not acceptable. We must address our elders with usted. There are roles each family member has. As the “woman of the house”, your responsibilities include but are not limited to cleaning home, cooking, taking care of children, and making sure you are always home at a reasonable hour. As a woman visiting other homes, you always offer help. This is a way to show respect.  Other than responsibilities and how to greet your elders, there are other unspoken rules. For example, before you go to sleep and when you wake up you say good morning and “la bendición mami y la bendición papi”. As a response you would usually get “dios te bendiga”.  When we do this, we are asking for a blessing and are told “may god bless you”. There are also other customs. It’s customary to say “duen provecho”. This is a way to say enjoy your meal.

I hold my Filipino culture dearly because of the food. There is a gathering we call a Boodle Fight where big banana leaves are laid out on multiple tables filled with rice, grilled seafood, pork, chicken, etc. During a Boodle Fight, family and friends come together and eat everything on the banana leaf with their bare hands. It is special because it is a moment I've had filled with laughter, good food and the company of amazing family. I think the best part about the Boodle Fight is that it can be celebrated any time.

Instead of hugs and kisses, we have to ""bless"". This means that the elderly will put their hand out for you to reach and put on your forehead and say ""bless"". Another unspoken rule is about skin color. Filipinos are stuck to the mentality of keeping their skin as light as possible. Despite the powerful heat, individuals will wear layers of sweaters with jeans in order to hide their skin from the sun. I grew up with this idea that being light meant being better. That mentality changed when I moved to New York and opened up to the American culture of being tan is the way to go. However, there is an unspoken view of light skin supremacy across the world. This is where the Filipino and American culture cross paths. The racism in American influenced the views Filipinos have on skin color.

My fathers family came from Virginia and can trace their names far enough back to plantations. My mother’s family is born and bred in Puerto Rico, only moving from the island in the last two generations, my mother and her siblings settled nicely on the mainland, my grandparents drifting to and from without any commitment. I am biracial but raised in my mother’s household. I did not learn about my Blackness from her, but I learned that rice is mandatory with every dinner, that it’s okay that I listen to music when I don’t know what the lyrics mean, that while my mother and her siblings don’t speak Spanish now, they learn it again today with pride instead of shame. I was not raised by my fathers family, but they gave me gospel, fried foods and distant memories of full bellies and tanned shoulders in the summer. I’m not part of either household now, having found my own identity and chosen a different journey but I have found the joys of the city, of being thankful and fostering lifelong relationships with people that don’t share the same blood with me.

Christmas festivities don’t start the 25th or even a few days before but on the 16th. Starting from the 16th to Christmas Eve, Colombians participate in “novenas"" which happen each night where everyone from family to neighbors gets together, pray and sing Hispanic Christmas carols. A nativity scene is an iconic part of Christmas. It is also known as a “pesebre” which are insanely elaborate where people go as far as putting real running water or as many lights as possible. Christmas also brings holiday foods like my favorite, Buñuelos.  Nothing compares to the memory of making these fried, cheesy,  doughy treats from scratch on Christmas eve with my grandmother. Other holiday foods include natilla, (a custard) and lechona (pork). Christmas Eve comes with a lot of superstitious activities. One I participated in this year was eating twelve grapes at midnight, each representing a wish as well as good luck for the year. Another is running outside around the block with a suitcase to travel a lot during the year.","There is a lot of pressure put on a child to respect their elders. In the Spanish language, there is tu and usted. Tu is referring to someone else but in an informal setting, usually talking to friends meanwhile usted is more formal. Usted is used for older people. In Colombia, usted is more popular than tu even when talking to close friends. Usted is used as a sign of having more respect for a person, it is also tied to having a higher education because of how formal it is. Elders are seen as all-knowing wise people. When they tell you to do something you don’t question it and if you do, it is a sign of disrespect. Family ties are strong in Latin households which usually house up to 3 generations of family. It is a tradition to take care of older generations and is assumed that the parent will be taken care of in the future and not put in a nursing home instead. Other unspoken rules surrounding social interactions is how there is a lot of negative stigma surrounding talking about both emotions and mental health. Self-reliance when it comes to having problems is valued in the Latin community so it is frowned upon to discuss them. There are negative labels put on people who want to talk through their problems and people are afraid to talk to others who may not understand different cultural issues.

Having a hispanic heritage, family holds close to our hearts. The food is also very typical and can always be centered around a rice plater, beans and a choice of protein. Music in my household growing up always involved the typical famous colombian salsa.","A couple of typical unspoken rules in my household are always greeting the guest who walks in the house, asking about others day, and offering to help out with household duties. Throughout hispanic culture it is very typical to respect and care for your elders. My family really emphasized to me that our elders take care of us when we're young so it is only right to do the same for them when they get old. Elders in my culture are really cared for and put on a pedestal. Some unspoken rules regarding friendship is support and willingness to provide a helping hand for someone because you never know what they're going through.
