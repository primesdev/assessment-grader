I had to take it upon myself to look for resources to help with the college process. Applying to medical school is a whole different situation. While I do have resources at my college, I feel like it's more comforting to be able to meet with someone individually. At Hunter, a majority of the STEM majors are actively pursuing medical school. So there's only so much our pre-health advisors can do for us. It's just better to have an individualized experience because they're able to address your personal issues over general issues of the student body. Everyone's path to medical school is different. Being able to hear someone's story will help me pinpoint where to start. Also having someone's feedback on what you were already doing (summer research, clinical research) is helpful.\"\n",

      " 'My strong desire to participate in PrIMES is based on my dedication to becoming a pediatrician within the next 7 years. In order to do so, I will need to know the steps necessary. PrIMES is the best way for me to acquire these tools considering I do not personally know anyone who has embarked on the journey to becoming a Medical Doctor.'\n",
      " \"I'd like to participate in PriMES because it is a great way of interacting with others in similar positions as me. As a minority and first generation college student in the United States, everything relating to my education has been full of firsts and this is the type of program I have been looking for to help me go further than what I can tell from reading online and listening to talks. I enjoy listening to other's paths and I realize that there is more than one way to becoming a medical professional.\"\n",

PrIMES goals in setting a curriculum and benchmarks with a mentor provide the guidance I seek on my path to medical school. Likewise, the pairing with a minority student who understands the process is a great resource to a prospective medical student like myself. I understand that PrIMES will set me up for success.'\n",
      " 'I want to participate in PrIMES because I believe mentors have a great influence on people who want to pursue something that they specialize in.

The first time I attended college (straight out of high school), I felt unprepared, like if I hadn't received the same education as my peers. This time around, I feel more wise and have taught myself how to take advantage of my sources and study hard, but a part of me still feels lost/feels like I am not good enough compared to others who had a stronger educational background.

It is special because it is a moment I've had filled with laughter, good food and the company of amazing family. I think the best part about the Boodle Fight is that it can be celebrated any time.

I was not raised by my fathers family, but they gave me gospel, fried foods and distant memories of full bellies and tanned shoulders in the summer.

The guest would naturally have to continue conversations and the host would be in charge of handling that the guests were not bored. I remember that I would always ask if the guest\\'s would like water but my mom and aunts would say, \"Andrea you don\\'t ask, you just give\".

I was also raised to form relationships with people who would have a positive impact on me for the sake of my mental wellness. Finally, the concept of time is widely emphasized.

      " 'We have to \"salye tout moun\" which is were we have to greet every one with a kiss on a cheek or if you are like me you just make cheek to cheek contact. Also, kids are expected to stay out of elder\\'s ways and business.'\n",
      " 'One huge rule in my household is that when a parent calls you, you answer with \"mande\" instead of \"what\" or \"yes\" because it shows respect to your elders. It is always courtesy to wait until everyone is at the table and ready before eating dinner and no one leaves the table until the last person is done.'\n",
      " 'Most rules are about respect and duty. When it comes to elders and older family members, you should always address them formally. Words like tu is not acceptable. We must address our elders with usted. There are roles each family member has. As the “woman of the house”, your responsibilities include but are not limited to cleaning home, cooking, taking care of children, and making sure you are always home at a reasonable hour. As a woman visiting other homes, you always offer help. This is a way to show respect.  Other than responsibilities and how to greet your elders, there are other unspoken rules. For example, before you go to sleep and when you wake up you say good morning and “la bendición mami y la bendición papi”. As a response you would usually get “dios te bendiga”.  When we do this, we are asking for a blessing and are told “may god bless you”. There are also other customs. It’s customary to say “duen provecho”. This is a way to say enjoy your meal. When it comes to morning, Dominicans morn differently to customs in the United States. Everyone shows up to the funeral because it’s whats required and instead of wearing all black clothing we wear all white and over time many may start to wear clothing with mute colors. There are other unspoken rules in my culture, but this is all I can think about at this moment.'\n",
      " 'In my culture, friendships with the opposite gender tend to be seen as \"strange.\" (I don\\'t agree with this) It\\'s also seen as disrespectful in my culture if you don\\'t offer something to drink to someone in your home.  When eating out, it\\'s part of the culture to \"fight\" over the bill and try to be the one that pays it.'\n",
      " 'A big unspoken rule is how you speak to your parents; even when your parents upset you, you don’t raise your voice higher than theirs. Friendships are believed to have a huge impact on the person you become, so the people you surround yourself with should be people who are reflective of you, or who make you better. We never leave an event on time. As you are leaving expect their to be seven new conversations before you have taken another step and said bye.'\n",
      " 'In the Filipino culture, we have an unspoken rule on greeting the elders as a sign of respect. Instead of hugs and kisses, we have to \"bless\". This means that the elderly will put their hand out for you to reach and put on your forehead and say \"bless\". Another unspoken rule is about skin color. Filipinos are stuck to the mentality of keeping their skin as light as possible. Despite the powerful heat, individuals will wear layers of sweaters with jeans in order to hide their skin from the sun. I grew up with this idea that being light meant being better. That mentality changed when I moved to New York and opened up to the American culture of being tan is the way to go. However, there is an unspoken view of light skin supremacy across the world. This is where the Filipino and American culture cross paths. The racism in American influenced the views Filipinos have on skin color. That is an unspoken rule that I wish didn\\'t exist in my everyday social interaction with Filipinos and Americans.'\n",
      " 'Courtesy in many culture is to have an underlying respect for everyone you encounter.  In my culture the attitudes towards elders is to have the most respect for them no matter who they are.

      " 'My mother’s family instilled in me a deep respect towards family and helping others in need. On my fathers side there is much more emphasis on respecting the elderly, as we have surviving family members who experienced segregation. Taking the values developed in me from my family, I adapted it to the LGBTQ culture of New York which emphasizes families of choice and impactful/meaningful relationships. Overall, I strive to surround myself with people I admire and respect and develop aspects of myself as I move throughout life.'\n",

      " 'At a very young age, my dad taught my sister and I that the way one shows respect to another is by looking at them in the eyes while they’re talking. Also, my family taught me that one must respect elders in anyway that is possible. Additionally, my family has enforced the concept of being at least fifteen minutes early to anything, whether that be a job, class or an event. Showing up early signifies a level of respect towards the activity one is attending. This is very important to me.'\n",
      " 'Where I grew up in Guyana, it is customary to greet everyone. Elders are treated with great respect. They are addressed formally unless they are know to you and in this case you would call them aunty or uncle. Friendships last long because trust and respect are the building blocks of the relationship. Children are taught how to respect their elders as well as have respect for their peers and everyone they interact with.'\n",

Howeverwever, I believe this has made me a little more receptive to new ideas and other cultural beliefs, especially in an academic setting.'\n",
      " 'Some outspoken rule around my everyday social interactions in my culture is that you never disrespect elders and always offer a helping hand to anyone regardless of age. Lately, I have noticed that the younger generations do not live by this rules which I was raised with and then proceed to question why some people lack common courtesy.'\n",
      " 'Respect towards elders is a big priority, and this is especially the case in religious settings. Hugging or some intimate sense of welcome can be expected. Generally, youth are to show courtesy and respect to those who are older- regardless of if they are related or even know one another.'\n",
      " 'In my culture, you are to not have malice or hatred towards anyone and have a forgiving heart. We treat people the way we like to be treated and if there is someone less fortunate in our midst, we help them by giving them the best we can provide. That could look like providing them a warm meal to even opening up our house to someone that needs it while taking into account how well we know them and if there trustworthy to not do anything bad. Friendship is a beautiful thing and is to be cherished and can last a lifetime but you have to recognize that there will be ups and downs. And the downs of the relationship come to strengthen your relationship, not tear it down.'\n",

      " 'There is a lot of pressure put on a child to respect their elders. In the Spanish language, there is tu and usted. Tu is referring to someone else but in an informal setting, usually talking to friends meanwhile usted is more formal. Usted is used for older people. In Colombia, usted is more popular than tu even when talking to close friends. Usted is used as a sign of having more respect for a person, it is also tied to having a higher education because of how formal it is. Elders are seen as all-knowing wise people. When they tell you to do something you don’t question it and if you do, it is a sign of disrespect. Family ties are strong in Latin households which usually house up to 3 generations of family. It is a tradition to take care of older generations and is assumed that the parent will be taken care of in the future and not put in a nursing home instead. Other unspoken rules surrounding social interactions is how there is a lot of negative stigma surrounding talking about both emotions and mental health. Self-reliance when it comes to having problems is valued in the Latin community so it is frowned upon to discuss them. There are negative labels put on people who want to talk through their problems and people are afraid to talk to others who may not understand different cultural issues. It is an unspoken rule to put forth the image of being happy and successful all the time.'\n",

      " 'Elders are really valued in the Mexican culture since they have lived for the longest they represents wisdom and their kids are in charge of taking care of them once they are no longer available to look out for themselves. Time is really valued by Mexicans, if you’re late to any event and you don’t let them know the host of the event will feel disrespected and they’ll probably never invite you to another event. Most of the friendships in Mexico are really close because you practically grow up with them so your bond ends up being really strong.'\n",
      " \"A couple of typical unspoken rules in my household are always greeting the guest who walks in the house, asking about others day, and offering to help out with household duties. Throughout hispanic culture it is very typical to respect and care for your elders. My family really emphasized to me that our elders take care of us when we're young so it is only right to do the same for them when they get old. Elders in my culture are really cared for and put on a pedestal. Some unspoken rules regarding friendship is support and willingness to provide a helping hand for someone because you never know what they're going through. Eye contact is essentially in communicating because it displays interest in the conversation and attentiveness.\"]\n",
